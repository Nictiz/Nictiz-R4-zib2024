  <purpose value="A derived profile from [zib-AnatomicalLocation-BodyStructure](http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-AnatomicalLocation-BodyStructure) to provide a version better suited for implementation purposes. This profile augments the base profile with elements found in the various use cases that have adopted the zib." />

      <definition value="Zib AnatomicalLocation is mapped to both a profile on CodeableConcept (&lt;http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-AnatomicalLocation&gt;) and this BodyStructure profile. &#xA;&#xA;When it is required to convey a discrete Laterality (NL-CM:20.7.3) next to (or in absence of) the Location (NL-CM:20.7.4), this BodyStructure profile should be used and referenced from the relevant resource. In cases where Laterality is either unnecessary or embedded within the location code itself, it can be conveyed directly in the relevant resource.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Note:** Receiving systems must support both the BodyStructure resource and the CodeableConcept in host resources, as either mechanism may be employed. Providing systems can select the appropriate mechanism based on their data requirements." />
