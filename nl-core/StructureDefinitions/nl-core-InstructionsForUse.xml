      <comment value="This element _mostly_ represents the DosingInstructions container from zib InstructionsForUse, but also includes the AdditionalInstructions and RouteOfAdministration concepts, which are normally placed on the same level as this container. As a result, these concepts are **duplicated** in every repetition of this element, even though these concepts should be present just once according to the zib.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This element does not contain a mapping to the Dosage container from zib InstructionsForUse. However, all child concepts of the Dosage concept are mapped. If an instance of zib container DosingInstructions contains multiple Dosage containers, each of these results in a separate instance of the FHIR Dosage data type conforming to this profile, wherein `.sequence` (zib concept SequenceNumber) and `.timing.repeat.bounds[x]:boundsDuration` (zib concept DoseDuration) are equal." />
