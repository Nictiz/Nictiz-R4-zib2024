    StructureDefinition:
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-08: 'The title of the StructureDefinition should conform to the profiling guidelines'"
        reason: The title is shown in the hosting profiles as the name of the datatype. "zib HealthProfessional Reference" is more descriptive than the title according to the profiling guidelines ("pattern NlCoreHealthProfessionalReference").

pattern-ZibHealthProfessionalReference:
  ignored issues:
    StructureDefinition:
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-08: 'The title of the StructureDefinition should conform to the profiling guidelines'"
        reason: The title is shown in the hosting profiles as the name of the datatype. "zib HealthProfessional Reference" is more descriptive than the title according to the profiling guidelines ("pattern ZibHealthProfessionalReference").

zib-Encounter:
  zib deviations:
    Encounter.class:
      - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
        reason: Encounter.class is mandatory in FHIR. The cardinality matches the cardinality in the zib, however, it does not match with the conceptual cardinality concept. This should not be a major problem.
    Encounter.participant:healthProfessional.individual:
      - cardinality: 0..1 instead of 0..*
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..*) and FHIR (0..1) is explained by the parent participant element that may exist 0..* times, thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
    Encounter.participant:responsibleHealthProfessional.type:
      - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
        reason: The cardinality matches the cardinality in the zib, however, it does not match with the conceptual cardinality concept. This should not be a major problem.

# These might occur in one or more profiles, or in none if they have been fixed in the meantime.
