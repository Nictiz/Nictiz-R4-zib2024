issues should occur: true

zib-AddressInformation:
  zib deviations:
    Address.line.extension:houseNumberIndication.value[x]:
      - datatype: string instead of CD
        reason: The mapping of zib AddressInformation on the FHIR Address datatype is the result of compatibility with HL7v3, which is the format that a lot of healthcare data in the Netherlands is stored in. As a result of this, the zib concept HouseNumberIndication with CD datatype is mapped to a FHIR string datatype.
    Address.line.extension:*.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
        reason: The value of the extension is required, but the extension itself is optional, making the effective cardinality 0..1 as required by the zib.

zib-ContactInformation-TelephoneNumbers:
  zib deviations:
    ContactPoint.system:
    - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
      reason: Although TelecomType and NumberType are optional in the zib, ContactPoint.system is used to identify the TelephoneNumbers concept itself when this datatype is added to a profile. If only a telephone number is given without TelecomType and NumberType, it will fall in the default slice of the sliced element with datatype ContactPoint.

zib-ContactPerson:
  zib deviations:
    RelatedPerson.name:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The name information according to zib NameInformation may be split up over multiple instances of RelatedPerson.name.
      - datatype: HumanName instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:3.1.4 (RelatedPerson.NameInformation)
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: HumanName instead of ST
        for: NL-CM:1.1.5 (Payer.PayerName)
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a string.
    RelatedPerson.name:nameInformation:
      - datatype: HumanName instead of rootconcept
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
    RelatedPerson.telecom:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        for: NL-CM:3.1.6 (ContactPerson.ContactInformation)
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:3.1.6 (ContactPerson.ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.6.1 (ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        for: NL-CM:1.1.12 (Payer.ContactInformation)
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:1.1.12 (Payer.ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
    RelatedPerson.telecom:*:
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of container
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a BackboneElement.
    RelatedPerson.address:
      - datatype: Address instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:3.1.5 (ContactPerson.AddressInformation)
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: Address instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:1.1.17 (Payer.AddressInformation)
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: Address instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.5.1 (AddressInformation)
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.        

zib-HealthcareProvider:
  zib deviations:
    Location.telecom:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:17.2.6 (HealthcareProvider.ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.6.1 (ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Location.telecom:*:
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of container
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a BackboneElement
    Location.address:
      - cardinality: 0..1 instead of 0..*
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..*) and FHIR (0..1) is explained by the restriction of FHIR to limit the Location.address to a physical address while the zib allows for other types of addresses (e.g. a postal address). Other types of addresses than a physical address are given in Organization.address which is referenced by Location.managingOrganization.
      - datatype: Address instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:17.2.5 (HealthcareProvider.AddressInformation)
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: Address instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.5.1 (AddressInformation)
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.

zib-NameInformation:
  zib deviations:
    HumanName.prefix:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: Both prefix and suffix are mapped to the Titles concept from the zib. There's a mismatch however in the way this information is represented in the zib and in FHIR. The mapping is documented in the profile.
    HumanName.suffix:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: Both prefix and suffix are mapped to the Titles concept from the zib. There's a mismatch however in the way this information is represented in the zib and in FHIR. The mapping is documented in the profile.
    HumanName.given:
      - short: FirstName / Initial
        reason: The zib defines both the complete list of first names and of initials as a single string. In FHIR this is done fundamentally different, by using separate names. Hence, the short has been changed to the singular form.
      - alias: first name,middle name,Voornaam,Initiaal
        reason: The first two initials are provided by FHIR. For the singular form of the latter two, see the remark above.
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: See the remark above.
    HumanName.family.extension:*.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
        reason: The value of the extension is required, but the extension itself is optional, making the effective cardinality 0..1 as required by the zib.

zib-NameInformation.GivenName:
  zib deviations:
    HumanName.given:
      - cardinality: 1..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The GivenName is optional according to the zib, but when this datatype profile is used, a name should be provided.
      
ext-TimeIntervalDuration.value:
  zib deviations:
    Extension.value[x]:
      - alias: TijdsDuur instead of tijdsDuur
        for: NL-CM:20.3.4 (Extension.value[x])
        reason: The zib concept name "tijdsDuur" is incorrect, concept names should begin with a capital letter. This will be fixed in a next version of the zibs (ZIB-2551).

unmapped zib concepts:
  - NL-CM:17.2.10: HealthcareProvider.LocationNumber
    reason: This zib concept is problematic to map cleanly to FHIR and it has been deemed too uncommon in practice to warrant an extension.

issues should occur: false

zib-ContactInformation-TelephoneNumbers:
  zib deviations:    
    ContactPoint.extension:comment.value[x]:
    - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
      reason: The cardinality of the extension itself is 0..1, making the effective cardinality 0..1 as required by the zib. It seems the QA tooling does not take into account the cardinality of the extension element itself.
    ContactPoint.extension:purpose.value[x]:
    - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
      reason: The cardinality of the extension itself is 0..1, making the effective cardinality 0..1 as required by the zib. It seems the QA tooling does not take into account the cardinality of the extension element itself.

zib-ContactPerson:
  ignored issues:
    RelatedPerson.address:
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-02: 'If mapping.map exists and the mapping is not implicit, short should exist'"
        reason: The short description is defined on the datatype profile and is not repeated in the differential.
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-04: 'If mapping.map exists and the mapping is not implicit, alias should exist.'"
        reason: The alias is defined on the datatype profile and is not repeated in the differential.

zib-HealthcareProvider:
  ignored issues:
    Location.address:
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-02: 'If mapping.map exists and the mapping is not implicit, short should exist'"
        reason: The required short description is given by the datatype profile, so it is absent from the differential.
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-04: 'If mapping.map exists and the mapping is not implicit, alias should exist.'"
        reason: The required alias is given by the datatype profile, so it is absent from the differential.   

zib-NameInformation:
  zib deviations:
    HumanName.extension:nameUsage.value[x]:
    - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
      reason: The cardinality of the extension itself is 0..1, making the effective cardinality 0..1 as required by the zib. It seems the QA tooling does not take into account the cardinality of the extension element itself.
