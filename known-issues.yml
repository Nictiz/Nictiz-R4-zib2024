# The issues here are deliberate deviations from the guidelines, as flagged by the qa tooling.
# For each issue documented, a reason for deviating from the guidelines is given.

issues should occur: true

ext-LanguageProficiency.CommunicationDetails:
  zib deviations:
    Extension.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 0..1 instead of 0..*
        reason: FHIR restricts Extension.value to a max cardinality of 0..1. To use it more than once, the extension is added 0..* in the hosting element.

pattern-NlCoreHealthProfessionalReference:
  ignored issues:
    StructureDefinition:
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-08: 'The title of the StructureDefinition should conform to the profiling guidelines'"
        reason: The title is shown in the hosting profiles as the name of the datatype. Since the title according to the profiling guidelines ("pattern NlCoreHealthProfessionalReference") is deemed confusing in some cases, the title is simply "Reference". See https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/MM-3854.

pattern-VitalSigns:
  ignored issues:
    Observation.category:VSCat:
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-13: 'Slice names should be camelCased starting with a lowercase letter.'"
        reason: This slice name is adopted from the Vital Signs profile.

pattern-ZibHealthProfessionalReference:
  ignored issues:
    StructureDefinition:
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-08: 'The title of the StructureDefinition should conform to the profiling guidelines'"
        reason: The title is shown in the hosting profiles as the name of the datatype. Since the title according to the profiling guidelines ("pattern ZibHealthProfessionalReference") is deemed confusing in some cases, the title is simply "Reference". See https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/MM-3854.

zib-AbilityToEat.EatingLimitations:
  zib deviations:
    Observation.value[x]:valueCodeableConcept:
      - cardinality: 0..1 instead of 0..*
        reason: The value can only occur once, but this profile is referenced 0..* times via .hasMember, making the effective cardinality 0..* as required by the zib.

zib-AbilityToUseToilet:
  zib deviations:
    Observation:
      - short: AbilityToUseToilet instead of ToiletUseAbility
        reason: The root of the zib is called "ToiletUseAbility" (which is incorrect), even though the zib itself is called "AbilityToUseToilet".

zib-AddressInformation:
  zib deviations:
    Address.line.extension:houseNumberIndication.value[x]:
      - datatype: string instead of CD
        reason: The mapping of zib AddressInformation on the FHIR Address datatype is the result of compatibility with HL7v3, which is the format that a lot of healthcare data in the Netherlands is stored in. As a result of this, the zib concept HouseNumberIndication with CD datatype is mapped to a FHIR string datatype.
    Address.line.extension:*.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
        reason: The value of the extension is required, but the extension itself is optional, making the effective cardinality 0..1 as required by the zib.

zib-BodyHeight:
  zib deviations:
    Observation.effective[x]:effectiveDateTime:
      - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
        reason: In the HL7 Vital Signs profile the .effective[x] element is required, which is adopted in the zib profile as well to align with the former profile as much as possible.

zib-ContactInformation-TelephoneNumbers:
  zib deviations:
    ContactPoint.system:
      - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
        reason: Although TelecomType and NumberType are optional in the zib, ContactPoint.system is used to identify the TelephoneNumbers concept itself when this datatype is added to a profile. If only a telephone number is given without TelecomType and NumberType, it will fall in the default slice of the sliced element with datatype ContactPoint.

zib-ContactPerson:
  zib deviations:
    RelatedPerson.name:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The name information according to zib NameInformation may be split up over multiple instances of RelatedPerson.name.
      - datatype: HumanName instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:3.1.4 (RelatedPerson.NameInformation)
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: HumanName instead of ST
        for: NL-CM:1.1.5 (Payer.PayerName)
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a string.
    RelatedPerson.name:nameInformation:
      - datatype: HumanName instead of rootconcept
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
    RelatedPerson.telecom:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        for: NL-CM:3.1.6 (ContactPerson.ContactInformation)
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:3.1.6 (ContactPerson.ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.6.1 (ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        for: NL-CM:1.1.12 (Payer.ContactInformation)
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:1.1.12 (Payer.ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
    RelatedPerson.telecom:*:
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of container
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a BackboneElement.
    RelatedPerson.address:
      - datatype: Address instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:3.1.5 (ContactPerson.AddressInformation)
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: Address instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:1.1.17 (Payer.AddressInformation)
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: Address instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.5.1 (AddressInformation)
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.

zib-HealthcareProvider:
  zib deviations:
    Location.telecom:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:17.2.6 (HealthcareProvider.ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.6.1 (ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Location.telecom:*:
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of container
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a BackboneElement
    Location.address:
      - cardinality: 0..1 instead of 0..*
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..*) and FHIR (0..1) is explained by the restriction of FHIR to limit the Location.address to a physical address while the zib allows for other types of addresses (e.g. a postal address). Other types of addresses than a physical address are given in Organization.address which is referenced by Location.managingOrganization.
      - datatype: Address instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:17.2.5 (HealthcareProvider.AddressInformation)
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: Address instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.5.1 (AddressInformation)
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.

zib-HealthProfessional-Practitioner:
  zib deviations:
    Practitioner.name:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The name information according to zib NameInformation may be split up over multiple instances of Practitioner.name.
      - datatype: HumanName instead of Reference
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Practitioner.name:nameInformation:
      - datatype: HumanName instead of rootconcept
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Practitioner.telecom:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        for: NL-CM:17.1.8 (HealthProfessional.ContactInformation)
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:17.1.8 (HealthProfessional.ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.6.1 (ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Practitioner.telecom:*:
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of container
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a BackboneElement.
    Practitioner.address:
      - datatype: Address instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:17.1.7 (HealthProfessional.AddressInformation)
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: Address instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.5.1 (AddressInformation)
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.

zib-HealthProfessional-PractitionerRole:
  zib deviations:
    PractitionerRole.telecom:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        for: NL-CM:17.1.8 (HealthProfessional.ContactInformation)
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:17.1.8 (HealthProfessional.ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.6.1 (ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
    PractitionerRole.telecom*:
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of container
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a BackboneElement.

zib-NameInformation:
  zib deviations:
    HumanName.family.extension:*.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
        reason: The value of the extension is required, but the extension itself is optional, making the effective cardinality 0..1 as required by the zib.
    HumanName.given:
      - short: FirstName / Initial
        reason: The zib defines both the complete list of first names and of initials as a single string. In FHIR this is done fundamentally different, by using separate names. Hence, the short has been changed to the singular form.
      - alias: first name,middle name,Voornaam,Initiaal
        reason: The first two initials are provided by FHIR. For the singular form of the latter two, see the remark above.
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: See the remark above.
    HumanName.prefix:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: Both prefix and suffix are mapped to the Titles concept from the zib. There's a mismatch however in the way this information is represented in the zib and in FHIR. The mapping is documented in the profile.
    HumanName.suffix:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: Both prefix and suffix are mapped to the Titles concept from the zib. There's a mismatch however in the way this information is represented in the zib and in FHIR. The mapping is documented in the profile.

zib-NameInformation.GivenName:
  zib deviations:
    HumanName.given:
      - cardinality: 1..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The GivenName is optional according to the zib, but when this datatype profile is used, a name should be provided.

zib-Patient:
  zib deviations:
    Patient.extension:nationality.extension:code.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
        reason: Zib Nationality is implemented using the complex core extension patient-nationality. The .value[x] element representing the concept Nationality has a 1..1 cardinality, but the "code" part of the extension itself is 0..1, making the cardinality effectively 0..1 as required by the zib.
    Patient.name:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The name information according to zib NameInformation may be split up over multiple instances of Patient.name.
      - datatype: HumanName instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:0.1.6 (Patient.NameInformation)
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: HumanName instead of ST
        for: NL-CM:1.1.5 (Payer.PayerName)
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a string.
    Patient.name:nameInformation:
      - datatype: HumanName instead of rootconcept
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Patient.telecom:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        for: NL-CM:0.1.5 (Patient.ContactInformation)
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:0.1.5 (Patient.ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.6.1 (ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        for: NL-CM:1.1.12 (Payer.ContactInformation)
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:1.1.12 (Payer.ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Patient.telecom:*:
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of container
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a BackboneElement.
    Patient.deceased[x]:deceasedDateTime:
      - short: DateOfDeath instead of DateOfDeath / DeathIndicator
        reason: This element is mapped to two zib concepts, DateOfDeath and DeathIndicator. However, the latter is implicit; although the zib recognizes both concepts, FHIR supports populating just one of them, thus DeathIndicator is assumed to be 'true' when DateOfDeath is populated. For clarity reasons, the .deceasedDateTime slice has only DateOfDeath mapped to it.
    Patient.address:
      - datatype: Address instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:0.1.4 (Patient.AddressInformation)
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: Address instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:1.1.17 (Payer.AddressInformation)
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: Address instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.5.1 (AddressInformation)
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Patient.multipleBirth[x]:multipleBirthInteger:
      - short: MultipleBirthSequence instead of MultipleBirthSequence / MultipleBirthIndicator
        reason: This element is mapped to two zib concepts, MultipleBirthSequence and MultipleBirthIndicator. However, the latter is implicit; although the zib recognizes both concepts, FHIR supports populating just one of them, thus MultipleBirthIndicator is assumed to be 'true' when MultipleBirthSequence is populated. For clarity reasons, the .multipleBirthInteger slice has only MultipleBirthSequence mapped to it.
    Patient.contact:
      - datatype: BackboneElement instead of rootconcept
        reason: The zib ContactPerson _may_ be represented as Patient.contact. There is a different use case as well, where the ContactPerson is implemented using a RelatedPerson resource.
    Patient.contact.extension:contactPerson.value[x]:
      - datatype: Reference instead of rootconcept
        reason: This is an additional reference to a separate zib-ContactPerson (RelatedPerson) instance, next to the information in Patient.contact. Patient.contact and RelatedPerson can both be used to capture the information from zib-ContactPerson, but each are used within a different context. Information may therefore be duplicated; this is the recommended way.
    Patient.contact.name:
      - datatype: HumanName instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:3.1.4 (ContactPerson.NameInformation)
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: HumanName instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.4.1 (NameInformation)
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Patient.contact.telecom:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:3.1.6 (ContactPerson.ContactInformation)
        reason: ContactInformation in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.6.1 (ContactInformation)
        reason: ContactInformation in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Patient.contact.telecom:*:
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of container
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a BackboneElement.
    Patient.contact.address:
      - cardinality: 0..1 instead of 0..*
        reason: Patient.contact is a restricted representation of contact persons containing only information needed to contact a contact person. The full address information should be captured using an instance of the zib-ContactPerson profile on RelatedPerson, which can be linked using an extension. This is explained in the profile.
      - datatype: Address instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:3.1.5 (ContactPerson.AddressInformation)
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: Address instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.5.1 (AddressInformation)
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Patient.communication:
      - datatype: BackboneElement instead of rootconcept
        reason: The appropriate representation of zib LanguageProficiency in FHIR is Patient.communication, not a separate resource.
    Patient.communication.extension:languageControl:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: Because of the nature of this extension the cardinality has a mismatch. Three zib concepts are mapped to this extension. Therefore the extension cannot be 0..1, but should be able to repeat.
      - datatype: Extension instead of CD
        reason: The mapping is placed on the extension and not on the .value[x] because of the nature of this extension. The extension itself contains a .valueCoding that is populated with the value of the zib. This datatype matches the zib CD type.
    Patient.communication.language:
      - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
        reason: The FHIR profiles are expected to implement zib cardinalities as conceptual cardinalities, but FHIR requires the .language element to be present. This aligns with the intention of the zib, as the Language concept is required for zib LanguageProficiency to make sense.

unmapped zib concepts:
  - NL-CM:17.2.10: HealthcareProvider.LocationNumber
    reason: This zib concept is problematic to map cleanly to FHIR and it has been deemed too uncommon in practice to warrant an extension.

zib-ContactInformation-TelephoneNumbers:
  zib deviations:
    ContactPoint.extension:comment.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
