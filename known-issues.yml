issues should occur: true

ext-LanguageProficiency.CommunicationDetails:
  zib deviations:
    Extension.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 0..1 instead of 0..*
        reason: FHIR restricts Extension.value to a max cardinality of 0..1. To use it more than once, the extension is added 0..* in the hosting element.

zib-NameInformation:
  zib deviations:
    HumanName.prefix:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: Both prefix and suffix are mapped to the "titles" concept from the zib. There's a mismatch however in the way this information is represented in the zib and in FHIR. The mapping is documented in the profile.
    HumanName.suffix:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: Both prefix and suffix are mapped to the "titles" concept from the zib. There's a mismatch however in the way this information is represented in the zib and in FHIR. The mapping is documented in the profile.
    HumanName.given:
      - short: FirstName / Initial
        reason: The zib defines both the complete list of first names and of initials as a single string. In FHIR this is done fundamentally different, by using separate names. Hence, the short has been changed to the singular form.
      - alias: first name,middle name,Voornaam,Initiaal
        reason: The first two initials are provided by FHIR. For the singular form of the latter two, see the remark above.
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: See the remark above.
    HumanName.family.extension:*.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
        reason: The value of the extension is required, but the extension itself is optional, making the effective cardinality 0..1 as required by the zib.

zib-NameInformation.GivenName:
  zib deviations:
    HumanName.given:
      - cardinality: 1..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The GivenName is optional according to the zib, but when this datatype profile is used, a name should be provided.

zib-Patient:
  zib deviations:
    Patient.name*:
      - datatype: HumanName instead of a reference
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Patient.name:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The name information according to zib NameInformation may be split up over multiple instances of Patient.name.
    Patient.telecom*:
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of a reference
        reason: ContactInformation in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Patient.telecom:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        for: NL-CM:0.1.5 (Patient.ContactInformation)
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib part ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
    Patient.address:
      - datatype: Address instead of a reference
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Patient.deceased[x]:deceasedDateTime:
      - short: DateOfDeath instead of DateOfDeath / DeathIndicator
        reason: This element is mapped to two zib concepts, DateOfDeath and DeathIndicator. However, the latter is implicit -- although the zib recognizes both concepts, FHIR supports populating just one of them, thus DeathIndicator is assumed to be true when DateOfDeath is populated. For clarity reasons, the .deceasedDateTime slice has only DateOfDeath mapped to it.
      - datatype: dateTime instead of boolean
        reason: The boolean expected by DeathIndicator is only assumed; see the explanation above.    
    Patient.multipleBirth[x]:multipleBirthInteger:
      - short: MultipleBirthSequence instead of MultipleBirthSequence / MultipleBirthIndicator
        reason: This element is mapped to two zib concepts, MultipleBirthSequence and MultipleBirthIndicator. However, the latter is implicit -- although the zib recognizes both concepts, FHIR supports populating just one of them, thus MultipleBirthIndicator is assumed to be true when MultipleBirthSequence is populated. For clarity reasons, the .multipleBirthInteger slice has only MultipleBirthSequence mapped to it.
      - datatype: integer instead of boolean
        reason: The boolean expected by MultipleBirthIndicator is only assumed; see the explanation above.

# The following issues are not "real" deviations stemming from design choices, but rather problems that pop up due to

# These might occur in one or more profiles, or in none if they have been fixed in the meantime. 

issues should occur: false

zib-AddressInformation:
  zib deviations:
    Address.line.extension:houseNumberIndication.value[x]:
      - datatype: string instead of CD
        reason: The mapping of zib AddressInformation on the FHIR Address datatype is the result of compatibility with HL7v3, which is the format that a lot of healthcare data in the Netherlands is stored in. As a result of this, the zib concept HouseNumberIndication with CD datatype is mapped to a FHIR string datatype with a constraint added (the value can only be 'by' or 'to' or 'OTH').
    Address.line.extension:*.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
        reason: The value of the extension is required, but the extension itself is optional, making the effective cardinality 0..1 as required by the zib.

zib-Patient:
  ignored issues:
    Patient.address:
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-02: 'If mapping.map exists and the mapping is not implicit, short should exist'"
        reason: The short description is defined on the datatype profile and not repeated in the differential.
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-04: 'If mapping.map exists and the mapping is not implicit, alias should exist.'"
        reason: The alias is defined on the datatype profile and not repeated in the differential.
